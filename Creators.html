		<strong>The Team</strong> <br>
		Our names are Kelsey Segren and Josiah Gallegos. We are students at Whitworth University looking to create a program to help the greater society <br>
		while still catering to what we both enjoy most: baseball and making games. With Kelsey's love of baseball and Josiah's enjoyment in making games,<br>
		<b>Beta Baseball</b> was created. <br><br>

		I am a senior, Mathematical Economics major from Bellingham, WA. This major has prepared me to pursue a career in the field of data analytics <br>
		which I hope to gear toward working in a baseball analytics department in the future. My passion for baseball started by simply keeping score <br>
		with pencil and a scorebook and then using an IPad app. The app was able to record lots of statistics including spray charts. Being able to make <br>
		 predictions based on a sample of data fascinated me when I was only 14 and continues to this day. <br><br>

		I am a junior double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science that's twenty years old and comes from Happy Valley, Oregon. I chose these fields <br>
		of study because I loved the problem solving aspect of each but now look to use them to develop video games in the future. I've always had a knack for <br>
		challenging my abilities and the abilities of my friends yet also had the desire to create and be imaginative, and so my passion for making video games <br>
		began.
