		<strong>The Problem we want to solve / The utility of our program</strong> <br>
		Our program allows the user to see many different player statistics in one location and lets them see those statistics function in a simulated game <br>
		 in which they themselves can interact with. The user also gets to decide the actions of the game as if they were the coach, such as having a player come in to pinch hit. <br>
		The program does all this and in an entertaining way, better than simply looking at charts of statistics. The typical simulation deosn't allow the user to <br>
		actually play the game like the player and make choices like the coach.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Target Audience</strong> <br>
		The targeted audience for our program could easily range from kids looking for entertainment to major league front offices wanting to analyze different <br>
		team dynamics and player abilities. As for a specific age range we could estimate anywhere from ages 6 to 80 using our program, but because we would like <br>
		to focus more on the game side of our program, we see it being more favored by a younger audience. If we feel satisfied in what we've done for our game <br>
		we would look to add more to the statistical side of the game for better analysis and greater appeal to older audiences. This could be in the form of <br>
		another game mode more focused on the statistics.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Device and System Requirements</strong> <br>
		As of now we plan to have the program made for the computer, and so the only device requirements we or our users would need is a computer. As for system requirements, <br>
		we would need information on baseball player statistics. We were looking at using web services such as <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Baseball Reference</a> and/or <br>
		<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&game_type='R'&season=2018&season_type=ANY&league_code='MLB'&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1549143785078" target="_blank">MLB Statistics</a>
		for our information needs. We would likely need to store a little data for images.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Audience Feedback</strong> <br>
		Upon talking with potential users of our program, we discovered what users would be looking for in such a game as Beta Baseball. To summarize, people want <br>
		a game that has good visuals and music, is fun and easy to use, competitive, and has achievements and a leader board to relate with others. Others would <br>
		like to see real statistics and have them accurately coincide with the user's ability. <br>
		<br>
		Features to Add Based off Audience Feedback:
		<ul>
			<li>Easy to Use: We'll focus on providing easy to understand directions and doing a lot of user testing.</li>
			<li>Real Statistics: We'll focus on incorporating realistic scenarios through accurate, up-to-date statistics from a baseball statistics reference</li>
			<li>
				Competitive: Hopefully using the statistics will ensure different outcomes, so competition will be enabled through team creation and <br>
				statistics in action and how the user playes with the given statistics. We'll also allow for player versus player games which will naturally<br>
				elicit competition. I guess we can also make sure that each side has a real chance to win.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fun: We'll give the user free will over how the game is set up and played. We'll make sure nothing is predetermined so the user doesn't feel like<br>
				they're just walking through a simulation.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Helpful Azure Services</strong> <br>
		The other Azure services we're considering using are the SQL databases resource and the storage accounts resource. We could use an Azure SQL database to move<br>
		statistics information from our used website into to then have the information stored and organized. Then we would draw from the database to provide statistics <br>
		for the game itself. We would use storage accounts to hold images and files to save for the game. This way we could save information and have a centralized <br>
		source of images.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Skills of Our Group and Other Groups and Where They Fit</strong> <br>
		The group of Kyle and J seemed to have a lot of experience with making games. They also seemed capable in game gaphics which we could use. They seemed to have<br>
		good perspective of baseball games as well: they liked how our game would consistently update its statistics. <br> 
		<br>
		Our group has baseball knowledge, mock-up skills and more game making experience. Each group could use some mock-up abilities! <br> 
		<br>
		30Weeks Roles
		<ul>
			<li>Designer: Our group (Kelsey and Josiah) fit into the designer role because we learn, build, and launch the service.</li>
			<li>Program Staff: We also fit into the role of program staff because we manage the design, develop the service, and deliver the program.</li>
			<li>Residents: We think Pete would be our Resident because he curates content, chooses speakers, and has experience and a vast network.</li>
			<li>Collaborators: Our classmates would be our collaborators because they offer different skills and work to us. They can also offer feedback and critique.</li>
			<li>Extended Network: Other professors and students who could provide knowledge or has interest in our work could be our extended network.</li>
			<LI>Governance: Both Pete and ourselves could be the governance. We can both provide strategic direction and long-term goals and we're all the key stakeholders.</li>
		</ul>
