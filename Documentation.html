		<strong>The Problem we want to solve / The utility of our program</strong> <br>
		Our program allows the user to see many different player statistics in one location and lets them see those statistics function in a simulated game <br>
		 in which they themselves can interact with. The user also gets to decide the actions of the game as if they were the coach, such as having a player come in to pinch hit. <br>
		The program does all this and in an entertaining way, better than simply looking at charts of statistics. The typical simulation deosn't allow the user to <br>
		actually play the game like the player and make choices like the coach.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Target Audience</strong> <br>
		The targeted audience for our program could easily range from kids looking for entertainment to major league front offices wanting to analyze different <br>
		team dynamics and player abilities. As for a specific age range we could estimate anywhere from ages 6 to 80 using our program, but because we would like <br>
		to focus more on the game side of our program, we see it being more favored by a younger audience. If we feel satisfied in what we've done for our game <br>
		we would look to add more to the statistical side of the game for better analysis and greater appeal to older audiences. This could be in the form of <br>
		another game mode more focused on the statistics.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Device and System Requirements</strong> <br>
		As of now we plan to have the program made for the computer, and so the only device requirements we or our users would need is a computer. As for system requirements, <br>
		we would need information on baseball player statistics. We were looking at using web services such as <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Baseball Reference</a> and/or <br>
		<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&game_type='R'&season=2018&season_type=ANY&league_code='MLB'&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1549143785078" target="_blank">MLB Statistics</a>
		for our information needs. We would likely need to store a little data for images.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Audience Feedback</strong> <br>
		Upon talking with potential users of our program, we discovered what users would be looking for in such a game as Beta Baseball. To summarize, people want <br>
		a game that has good visuals and music, is fun and easy to use, competitive, and has achievements and a leader board to relate with others. Others would <br>
		like to see real statistics and have them accurately coincide with the user's ability. <br>
		<br>
		Features to Add Based off Audience Feedback:
		<ul>
			<li>Easy to Use: We'll focus on providing easy to understand directions and doing a lot of user testing.</li>
			<li>Real Statistics: We'll focus on incorporating realistic scenarios through accurate, up-to-date statistics from a baseball statistics reference</li>
			<li>
				Competitive: Hopefully using the statistics will ensure different outcomes, so competition will be enabled through team creation and <br>
				statistics in action and how the user playes with the given statistics. We'll also allow for player versus player games which will naturally<br>
				elicit competition. I guess we can also make sure that each side has a real chance to win.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fun: We'll give the user free will over how the game is set up and played. We'll make sure nothing is predetermined so the user doesn't feel like<br>
				they're just walking through a simulation.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Helpful Azure Services</strong> <br>
		The other Azure services we're considering using are the SQL databases resource and the storage accounts resource. We could use an Azure SQL database to move<br>
		statistics information from our used website into to then have the information stored and organized. Then we would draw from the database to provide statistics <br>
		for the game itself. We would use storage accounts to hold images and files to save for the game. This way we could save information and have a centralized <br>
		source of images.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Skills of Our Group and Other Groups and Where They Fit</strong> <br>
		The group of Kyle and J seemed to have a lot of experience with making games. They also seemed capable in game gaphics which we could use. They seemed to have<br>
		good perspective of baseball games as well: they liked how our game would consistently update its statistics. <br> 
		<br>
		Our group has baseball knowledge, mock-up skills and more game making experience. Each group could use some mock-up abilities! <br> 
		<br>
		30Weeks Roles
		<ul>
			<li>Designer: Our group (Kelsey and Josiah) fit into the designer role because we learn, build, and launch the service.</li>
			<li>Program Staff: We also fit into the role of program staff because we manage the design, develop the service, and deliver the program.</li>
			<li>Residents: We think Pete would be our Resident because he curates content, chooses speakers, and has experience and a vast network.</li>
			<li>Collaborators: Our classmates would be our collaborators because they offer different skills and work to us. They can also offer feedback and critique.</li>
			<li>Extended Network: Other professors and students who could provide knowledge or has interest in our work could be our extended network.</li>
			<LI>Governance: Both Pete and ourselves could be the governance. We can both provide strategic direction and long-term goals and we're all the key stakeholders.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Break Down</strong> <br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Statistics grabbing: We will take statistics from Baseball Reference and how we'll do that is essentially going into its HTML and pinpointing<br>
				the numbers and images needed within the HTML. We'll use pattern-finding code to recognize where the information is in the site's HTML to then<br>
				retrieve the stat/image. For example we can grab an individual player's batting average implementing code that searches for the body in the HTML<br>
				then finds a "batting average" label to them take the data right after/before it. The data can then be stored into an Azure database.
			</li>
			<li>
				Team Layout: Team and player information stored in the database will be extracted and used to layout in a user interface each team and each<br>
				player in that team. Team rosters will be constantly updated by the updating of the database from the website. The layout will have a list of <br>
				teams to look through on the left each with their team logo and upon clicking on a team, the team roster will show up right of the teams to then <br>
				choose from.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inning Summary: At the end of an inning the statistics of that inning will be momentarilly displayed on the screen. These statistics include <br>
				hits, runs, errors, and players left on base. The display will last until the user hits enter so that the previous inning summary does not <br>
				remain on the screen. We'll keep track of the stats by having different variables for each stat and updating the variables as the game is <br>
				played, for example giving the runs variable +1 every time a player scores.
			</li>
			<li>
				Hitting and running: When a player is up to bat, the user can hit the space bar at the right time to hit the pitched ball and then run to the<br>
				base by alternating the right and left arrow keys. The user will also have an option to continue running to the next base by hitting the up <br>
				arrow.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Problem Solving Brainstorm</strong> <br>
		<br>
		Problems and how to solve them:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Which player statistics to use: Since there are so many statistics to choose from, we're going to have to decide which ones are useful in our<br>
				program. We could physically look through all the offered stats and omit those we feel aren't useful to our program. We could ignore the problem<br>
				and just include as many stats as we can. We could do some research and find out what experts (statiticians and baseball writers) say about <br>
				which stats influence the game more.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stats versus user skill: We see a problem in integrating both the user's skills and the player's statistics in how the game is played. We could<br>
				(in terms of batting) just incorporate both and have the player's hit percent work with how accurately the user swings. We could ignore some<br>
				stats and focus on user skill (leans more towards fun aspect rather than realistic simulation). We could ignore user ability (they wouldn't <br>
				press the space bar to swing, which leans more towards simulation).
				 
			</li>
			<li>
				Ending the game: Actual baseball games last 9+ innings (baseball games could theoretically last forever), so we'll need to think of when to <br>
				end the game. We could have a time limit. We could have a score limit and hope they reach it. We could just go nine innings (ignore time). <br>
				We could go nine innings with some tie-breaker we create to make sure the game doesn't last too long. We could go less innings (any number we <br>
				want). We could see what modern baseball games do.
			</li>
			<li>
				Incorporate an opponent: The opponent could be another person or a computer. It's more of a problem if it's a computer. To solve that we could<br>
				have the computer's turn to bat simulated in a way (if there's no active field-play). We could have the computer set to one difficulty (act the<br>
				same when up to bat or in the field every time).
			</li>
			<li>
				How much field-play allowed: How complicated should we get in incorporating field play? We could implement everything that comes with typical<br>
				baseball. We could only allow a few interactive field-play elements (throwing ball).
			</li>
		</ol>
		Testing:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Draw comparisons to a realistic game turnout.
			</li>
			<li>
				Simply asking people what they prefer (statistics based versus skill based game).
			</li>
			<li>
				Measuring game length with different options. We'd pretedermine a good game length.
			</li>
			<li>
				Play against the opponent many times and determine whether it's too hard or too easy (nearly unbeatable or beatable every time).
			</li>
			<li>
				To see if the user is doing too much in the field we could ask for user feedback on the feel of the field-play. Is it too complicated?
			</li>
		</ol>
