		<strong>How it's played</strong>: <br>
		Begin the game by choosing your team as you view each player's statistics. <br>
		Then, place them in the desired field position or batting order. <br>
		Next, commence the game! If you're up to bat you'll be able to attempt to hit the ball by swinging at the opportune time and run from base to base using quick keyboard input, <br>
		while if you're in the field you'll be able to run to the ball and attempt to throw it base to base to attempt outs! <br>
